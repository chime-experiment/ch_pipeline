class HFBSelectTransit(task.SingleTask):
    """Find transit data through FRB beams.

    Task for selecting on- and off-source data. The task can do both, but only
    one at a time (which one is set by the `selection` attribute). The selection
    of data is determined by the following criteria (a single one or both can be
    used, as specified by the `criteria` attribute):

    1) The offset in RA of the time samples with respect to the nominal centre of
       the synthetic beam being considered. This results in a window of data that
       is includes (in the case of on-source selection) or excluded (in the case
       of off-source selection). The size of the window is measured in units of
       the half-width of the synthetic beams in the EW direction, and set by the
       `on_source_include_window` and `off_source_exclude_window` attributes.
    2) The sensitivity of the synthetic beam toward the source. This must be greater
       than some threshold (in the case of on-source selection) or lower than some
       ceiling (in the case of off-source selection). The threshold/ceiling is set
       by the `on_source_sens_threshold` and `off_source_sens_ceiling` attributes,
       as a fraction of the maximum sensitivity in the beam's main lobe. (The
       sensitivity of the last row of EW beams, EW index 3, is higher in the side
       lobes than the main lobe. If we were to use the maximum sensitivity of the
       beam per se to calculate the threshold needed for data selection, selected
       data won't be in the main lobe.)

    Attributes
    ----------
    selection : str
        What part of the data to select. Options are: 'on-source', 'off-source'.

        Criteria used to decide which time samples are selected. Possible entries:
        'offset' (i.e., the RA offset of the source to the centre of the beam),
        'sensitivity' (i.e., the synthetic beam sensitivity).
        Default is ['offset', 'sensitivity']
    on_source_include_window : float
        Half-width of the window to include when selecting on-source data in units
        of the EW half-width of the synthetic beams (beam and frequency dependent).
        Default is 1.0
    on_source_sens_threshold : float
        Fraction of maximum beam sensitivity above which samples are considered
        on-source.
        Default is 0.6
    off_source_exclude_window : float
        Half-width of the window to exclude when selecting off-source data in units
        of the EW half-width of the synthetic beams (beam and frequency dependent).
        A value of 10.0 excludes the first main sidelobe of the synthetic beams.
        A value of 18.0 excludes a further minor sidelobe, at the cost of requiring
        larger chunks of data around transit, especially at lower frequecies.
        Default is 18.0
    off_source_sens_ceiling : float
        Fraction of maximum beam sensitivity below which samples are considered
        off-source.
        Default is 0.005
    source_name : str
        Name of source, which should be in `ch_util.hfbcat.HFBCatalog`. If this is
        not provided, the task will look for it in the input container attributes.
    source_ra : float
        Right ascension of the source in degrees, in case this is not available in
        `ch_util.hfbcat.HFBCatalog` (or in case the value given there needs to be
        overridden manually).
    source_dec : float
        Declination of the source in degrees, in case this is not available in
        `ch_util.hfbcat.HFBCatalog` (or in case the value given there needs to be
        overridden manually).
    time_offset : float
        Time (is seconds) to add to the data times before comparison with the
        beam model. This is a temporary hack, to be removed when the data times
        are fully understood.
